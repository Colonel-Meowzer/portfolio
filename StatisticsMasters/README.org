* M.S. in Applied Statistics Cookbook

This repo contains the coursework and projects that were done over the course of my M.S. in Applied Statistics.

This is meant to be a portfolio of my progress as a Statistician, and a
reference as there are some helpful snippets in here.

** Courses
- /Probability & Statistics Series 1-3 (Not Shown)/
- Applied Statistics Series 1-3
- Applied Regression Analysis
- Time Series Analysis
- Generalized Linear Models
- Optimization Theory
- Monte Carlo Simulations
- Bayesian Statistics

** References
- [[http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tdw/files/cookbook-en.pdf][Probability & Statistics Cookbook]]

  While I do have notes from Probability and Statistics 1-3, this cookbook does
  an excellent job summarizing the content so in lieu of the laborious effort of
  copying my notes into here, this will do instead.
