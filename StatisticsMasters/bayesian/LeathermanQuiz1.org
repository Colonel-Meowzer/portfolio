* Question 1

#+begin_quote
Assuming the joint p.m.f below, are $X_1$ and $X_2$ independent? Justify your answer
#+end_quote

|       |    0 |   1 | Total |
|-------+------+-----+-------|
|     0 | 0.45 | 0.1 |  0.55 |
|     1 | 0.25 | 0.2 |  0.45 |
| Total |  0.7 | 0.3 |     1 |


By Bayes Rule, if $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent, then

$$
f(X_1 | X_2) = \frac{f(X_1, X_2)}{f_{X_2}(X_2)} = \frac{f_{X_1}(X_1)
f_{X_2}(X_2)}{f_{X_2}(X_2)} = f_{X_1}(X_1)
$$

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P (X_1 = 0) = & 0.7\\
P (X_2 = 0) = & 0.55\\
P (X_1 = 0, X_2 = 0) = & 0.45\\
\frac{0.45}{0.55} = & 0.8182 \neq 0.7
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Thus $X_1$ and $X_2$ are _dependent_.

* Question 2

#+begin_quote
To test a new pesticide, experimenters will spray a field and record the number
of moths caught in a trap placed in the center of the field for a week after
spraying as the outcome variable of the study.
#+end_quote


** a

#+begin_quote
What is the appropriate parametric family of distributions for the outcome
variable? Justify your answer
#+end_quote

The appropriate distribution to represent the outcome variable is the *Binomial*
distribution. The statistic of interest is the number of moths caught in the
trap which can be modeled as a number of /successes/ which is best modeled by
the Binomial Distribution.

** b

#+begin_quote
The parameter of interest is the mean number of moths. What is an appropriate
parametric family of distributions for this parameter? Justify your answer.
#+end_quote

With repeated sampling of the number of moths caught in the trap, a *Normal*
distribution could be used to estimate the mean number of moths since the
sampling distribution converges to a Normal distribution per the Central Limit
Theorem.
