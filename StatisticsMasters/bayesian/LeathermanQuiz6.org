A survey of commuters in 10 counties likely to be effected by a proposed
addition of a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane was conducted. Let $n_i$ be the
number of respondents in county $i$ and $Y_i$ be the number in favor of the HOV
lane. Consider two potential models for these data (responses are independent
over county for both models).

$$
\text{Model #1} \ \ \ Y_i \sim Binomial(n_i, p_i) \ \text{with priors} \ p_i
\sim Beta(0.5, 0.5)
$$

$$
\text{Model #2} \ \ \ Y_i \sim Binomial(n_i, p) \ \text{with priors} \ p
\sim Beta(0.5, 0.5)
$$

** a

#+begin_quote
Give the posterior distribution of $p$ under Model #2.
#+end_quote

Likelihood: $Y_i | p \sim Bin(n_i, p)$

Prior: $p \sim Beta(0.5, 0.5)$

Posterior: $p | Y_i \sim Beta(\sum_{1}^{p} Y_i + 0.5, \sum_{1}^{p} (n_i - Y_i) + 0.5)$

Given that a Beta Prior is conjugate when the Likelihood is Binomial.

** b

#+begin_quote
Give a scenario where inspecting the posterior distributions under the two
models would suggest that Model #2 is invalid.
#+end_quote

Model 2 suggests that all /i/ counties have a similar distribution in opinions
regarding HOV lanes. It is an unrealistic assumption. For example, opinions on
an HOV lane would likely be different between Cook and Kendall counties in
Illinois.

Each of /n/ study participants slept in a cold room for a month and a warm room
for a month. Let $Y_i$ be the difference between the average number of hours of
sleep per night in these two months. Assum $Y_1, ..., Y_n$ are independent and

$$
Y_1, ..., Y_n | \mu, \sigma^2 \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)
$$

with priors $\mu \sim N(0, 100)$ and $\sigma^2 \sim InvGamma(0.01, 0.01)$. The
goal is to test whether the mean of $Y_i$ is positive or negative. The
hypothesis are

$$
H_1: \mu < 0
$$

$$
H_2: \mu \geq 0
$$
#+end_quote

** a

#+begin_quote
Write an integral expression, denoting $p(\mu, \sigma^2 | Y)$ as the posterior
distribution for the posterior probability of $H_1$. Note that you do not need
to give an equation for p.
#+end_quote


\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P(\mu < 0, \sigma^2 | Y) = \int_{- \infty}^{0} \int_{0}^{\infty} P(\mu, \sigma^2 | Y) d \sigma^2 d \mu
\end{split}
\end{equation}

** b

#+begin_quote
Give three computational approaches to computing/approximating the posterior
probability of $H_1$. Give a Pro and Con of each.
#+end_quote

1. MCMC via Gibbs Sampling. This problem
   decomposes nicely into known Full Conditional distributions making it
   straightforward to implement but involves computation over a presumably
   largish number of iterations.
2. Compute MAP Estimators of priors, then MAP Estimator of posterior. Very fast
   but only provides a point estimate with no description of uncertainty.
3. Invoke Bayesian CLT by using MAP Estimators of the priors as parameters of the Likelihood function. This is faster than MCMC with Gibbs Sampling but ignores
   the uncertainty of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ which makes the credible interval narrower than they should be.
