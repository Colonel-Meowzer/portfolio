#+TITLE:     Generalized Linear Models
#+AUTHOR:    Dustin Leatherman

* Course Description

Applications of generalized linear models. Topics include generalized linear
models for non-normal continuous response, models for binary and multinomial
response data, models for count data, and analysis of variance and covariance.
The class of generalized linear models contains the models most commonly used in
statistical practice.
