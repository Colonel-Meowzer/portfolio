* Applied Time Series Analysis

** Course Description

Development of the Box-Jenkins methodology for the identification, estimation
and fitting of ARIMA, and transfer-function stochastic models for the purpose of
analyzing and forecasting stationary, non-stationary, and seasonal time series
data. The course emphasizes practical time series data analysis, using computer
packages and includes applications to economic, business and industrial
forecasting. f
